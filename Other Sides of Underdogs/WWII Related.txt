I learned something...
In the mid game
we were being ambushed
dominated by British Bofors
it's an anti aircraft gun
really evil
hahaha
coz it eats up my men
instantly obliterates the squad
and dami
4
they dominated the map
we were forced to retreat
Edi yan na tanks were rolling out
we were being ambushed my them
hundrerds of em
and my men took a stand
they help an area
I managed to get out one tank
a tank destroyer
kaso kinain rin ng sistema
It was utterly destroyed
hahahah
Then ayun a point was being taken
the area was full of tank
but I was able to gather up a lot of racketenwerfers
(Big anti tank wagons xD)
still they crushed the base I buit there
and destroyed it entirely
We were outnumbered
So many tanks
Most of them were heavy
meron pa silang...
Churchills
ugggh
overwhelmed, I ordered all of my troops to retreat
and I told them, 
Gib nicht auf!
(DO NOT GIVE UP)
Most of them were crying
crai crai
but I told them
If they're gonna take us
We'll give em a deng hard time to capture our base
so Here I was, standing in the battlegrounds ording everything
Spoons
Forks
Anything we can throw at them to defend our base
and boy we did
It really put the Tommies into shame
(Tommies = Brits)
IT was funny on how many anti tank guns I put there
we defended it as if we were pirates and our base was trrrrreasurreee
BOOM!
Fired the cannons endlessly
10-20 anti tank weaponry being put to the test
and it's crazy
we obliterated their tanks
with like
Spoons and forks
ahahaha
