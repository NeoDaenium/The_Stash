Lindee fell in love with Nix, but Nix had fallen in love with another girl.
It took sometime but Lindee realized she didn't need to find some guy because God was enough

And once she accepted that, she and Phoenix started to have sweeter times, and that's
when he decided to love her.

Revelations In Spaaaaace

In my loneliness, there was where I realized I was loved.
Loved by Someone I could not see, nor touch, but I can feel.

From the very first conquest, I realized how childish I was.
Looking for something that could fill the gap.

Someone.

But no one can. Technically, no human can.

But God can. The God Who made the universe, this beautiful scenery of different colored dots.
The God Who put every single object in the universe in it's place...
The God Himself who created me...

Loves me beyond understanding.

It took me 270 miles above the Earth to realize that.
Like5 Years? To grasp that concept?



He used every heartbreak that I felt to make me stronger.
It took 7 heartbreaks to make me realize,
I didn't have to look for the perfect love.

Because it was already there.
God was always there.
